-- We can do this becuase we can never have void in the zeroth place.

-- so, when are two type, `a` and `b`, considered equal?
-- a definition might be, it is possible to go from `a` to `b`,

-- Going a roundway trip should leave you the same value.
-- Unfortunately it is virtually impossible to test this in Haskell.
